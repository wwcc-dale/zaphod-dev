# To Do List

## Completed
- [x] Common Cartridge export (`export_cartridge.py`) - Exports full course to .imscc format

## In Progress
1. Outcome ratings file with replacement pattern {{ratings:default}} or would it be better to simply rely on an extension of includes?

## Future Enhancements
2. Add Canvas-specific extensions to CC export (discussion topics, announcements)
3. Add QTI 2.1 support as alternative to QTI 1.2
4. Add CC import capability (reverse of export)
5. Add selective export (--modules flag to export only specific modules)
6. Add export validation against CC 1.3 schema
