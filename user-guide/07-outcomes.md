## Outcomes in Zaphod

Outcomes in Zaphod describe what students should learn in your course, using plain text instead of Canvas’s outcome editor. They give you a central, version‑controlled list of your course learning outcomes that can be reused across assignments and rubrics.

### Where outcomes live

Each course keeps its outcomes together in a shared folder, typically something like:

```text
example-course/
  outcomes/
    outcomes.yaml
    outcomes_import.csv   # generated for Canvas, not hand-edited
```

- `outcomes.yaml` is the file you edit; it holds your course‑level outcomes in a human‑friendly format.  
- `outcomes_import.csv` is generated by Zaphod for Canvas’s Outcomes import tool; you don’t need to edit it directly.

This keeps your outcome definitions in one place instead of scattering them across individual assignments.

### Defining outcomes in `outcomes.yaml`

The YAML file usually has a list of course outcomes, each with a short code, a title, a description, and a set of rating levels. A simple example:

```yaml
course_outcomes:
  - code: CLO1
    title: Write clear, well-organized essays
    description: Students will be able to present a clear thesis and support it with coherent paragraphs.
    mastery_points: 8
    ratings:
      - description: Exceeds expectations
        points: 10
      - description: Meets expectations
        points: 8
      - description: Developing
        points: 6
      - description: Beginning
        points: 4

  - code: CLO2
    title: Use academic sources appropriately
    description: Students will be able to integrate and cite academic sources accurately.
    mastery_points: 8
    ratings:
      - description: Exceeds expectations
        points: 10
      - description: Meets expectations
        points: 8
      - description: Developing
        points: 6
      - description: Beginning
        points: 4
```

Key ideas:

- `code` is a short label you can use from rubrics (for example `CLO1`).  
- `title` and `description` are what you and students see in Canvas.  
- `ratings` and `mastery_points` describe how performance is interpreted for this outcome.

You can start with just a few outcomes and add more as your course design evolves.

### How outcomes connect to rubrics and Canvas

When you run the outcome sync step, Zaphod:

1. Reads `outcomes.yaml` and builds an import CSV in the right Canvas format.  
2. Imports that CSV so the outcomes appear (or update) in the course’s Outcomes area.  

Once the outcomes exist in Canvas, your rubric files can reference them by `code` on specific criteria. When you grade using those rubrics, Canvas can roll scores up into outcome‑level reports, helping you see how students are doing on each learning goal across multiple assignments.

If you later refine a title, description, or rating scale, you edit `outcomes.yaml` and rerun the sync. Canvas outcomes are updated to match, and any aligned rubrics continue to point to the same learning goals.

### Outcome map (one per course)

To let Zaphod connect rubric criteria to Canvas outcomes, you maintain a small “map” file that ties each outcome code (`CLO1`, `CLO2`, etc.) to the actual outcome ID in Canvas.

Unfortunately at this point outcome mapping is a manual process. It is on the list to automate via the Zaphod pipeline.

A simple example `outcome_map.json` might look like:

```json
{
  "CLO1": 12345,
  "CLO2": 12346
}
```

- The keys (`"CLO1"`, `"CLO2"`) match the `code` values from your outcomes file.
- The numbers (`12345`, `12346`) are the Canvas outcome IDs for those outcomes in this course.

Typically you would:

- Import outcomes once (manually or via Zaphod).
- Look up the outcome IDs in Canvas (or have Zaphod populate the map).
- Keep `outcome_map.json` under `_course_metadata/` or `outcomes/` and reuse it across assignments.

Once this map exists, Zaphod can read it and attach the correct Canvas outcome to each rubric row that references a code.
